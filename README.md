### Why choose us ?

##### Our user interface provides an easy to use enivronment for any user. The interface explains itself making the use of a helping tool unnecessary. This is very rare in some applications making our application superior in some cases. Not only that but the user interace has very pleasant color combinations giving the whole application a premium look.

##### Our application make sure to validate most of the data entered to it. This will result in optimaly lower erorrs when inputing data by the admin users. Which is the most prominent problem in most Learning Management Systems. Howerver, Elearn handles that perfectly making it very reliable to use without being error-prone.

##### Our Program uses QT framework to generate a seamless and responsive application by integrating our C++ code with the user interface. We have provided some documentation on our Class lists and heirarchy and documentation on their methods.
